A tool for managing my awful time management skills

# What helps with time management
for me it generally comes down to consistency and ease of accessability
this for example means that i am going to have a much better time using my phone than my pc as using my pc requires effort
so in short it needs to be able to manage the shit I don't like doing

what do i not like doing:
 - managing what I need to do in a day 
    - household chores / uni 
 - manage excersice 
 - manage manage my hygiene / nutrition
 - manage who owes me what
 - medication

what should i be doing:
 - journalling
 - 


what is the most efficient way to build something to manage this:
discord bot 

how am i going to do each bit:
 - a to-do list to manage what i do in the day
